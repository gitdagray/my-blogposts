**TLDR:** An Open Source fork of SheetJS lets you create and style Excel spreadsheets with JavaScript.

## Creating XLSX Files

An XLSX file is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. 

I previously documented [How to Download xlsx Files from a Next.js Route Handler](https://www.davegray.codes/posts/how-to-download-xlsx-files-from-a-nextjs-route-handler).  

In that blog post, I used the [xlsx](https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/getting-started/installation/frameworks) package which is also known as SheetJS. 

However, I discovered a limitation of the community edition of the xlsx package: It did not allow the row and cell styling that my stakeholders desired in their final product. 

The PRO edition does allow styling, but I looked for an open source solution and found it.

## xlsx-js-style

[xlsx-js-style](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx-js-style) is a fork of SheetJS combined with code from a couple of other open source projects that were adding styles to SheetJS. 

The only drawback I see is the last version was published 2 years ago, but it does not have the vulnerability I warned about if you install the [xlsx dependency](https://www.davegray.codes/posts/how-to-download-xlsx-files-from-a-nextjs-route-handler#xlsx-dependency) directly from npm.

[xlsx-js-style](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx-js-style) allows you to create Excel spreadsheets with JavaScript and style the cells with borders, colors, alignment, and font styles. 

## Add xlsx-js-style to Your Project

Install xlsx:

```bash
npm i xlsx-js-style
```

Next, import xlsx-js-style into your project:

```ts 
import XLSX from "xlsx-js-style"
```
You can use this package in any JavaScript or TypeScript project.

## Creating and Styling the XLSX Worksheet 

Here's an example of how to use the xlsx-js-style package:
 
```ts 
// define your headers 
const headers = [
    "FirstName",
    "LastName",
    "Email",
]

// set column widths
const colWidths = [
        { wch: 30 },
        { wch: 30 },
        { wch: 50 },
]

// get the data 
const userData = await getUserData()

// early return if no data
if (!userData || !userData[0]) {
    return null
}

// set header row height 
// consider if you have vertical headers
const headerRowHeight = [
    { hpt: 80 },
]

// Dynamically set row height based on size of data
const dataRowHeight = Array.from({ length: userData[0].length }, () => ({ hpt: 30 }))

// Combine header row height and data row height
const rowHeight = [...headerRowHeight, ...dataRowHeight]

// Create a new worksheet: 
const worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet([])

// Assign widths to columns
worksheet['!cols'] = colWidths

// Assign height to rows
worksheet['!rows'] = rowHeight

// Enable auto-filter for columns
worksheet['!autofilter'] = { ref: "A1:C1" }

// Add the headers to the worksheet: 
XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [headers])

// add data to sheet 
XLSX.utils.sheet_add_json(worksheet, userData, {
    skipHeader: true,
    origin: -1
})

// get size of sheet 
const range = XLSX.utils.decode_range(worksheet["!ref"] ?? "")
const rowCount = range.e.r
const columnCount = range.e.c

// Add formatting by looping through data in sheet 
for (let row = 0; row <= rowCount; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col <= columnCount; col++) {
        const cellRef = XLSX.utils.encode_cell({ r: row, c: col })

        // Add this format to every cell
        worksheet[cellRef].s = {
            alignment: {
                horizontal: "left",
                wrapText: true,
            },
        }

        // vertical header - 1st column only
        if (row === 0 && col === 0) {
            worksheet[cellRef].s = {
                //spreads in previous cell settings
                ...worksheet[cellRef].s,
                alignment: {
                    horizontal: "center",
                    vertical: "center",
                    wrapText: false,
                    textRotation: 180,
                },
            }
        }

        // Format headers bold
        if (row === 0) {
            worksheet[cellRef].s = {
                //spreads in previous cell settings
                ...worksheet[cellRef].s, 
                font: { bold: true },
            }
        }

    }
}

return worksheet

// After this, add worksheet to workbook, download, etc. 
// See docs and my previous article
```

## Other Styles Available

I only applied a few of the styles available in the above example. 

Checkout all of the available style settings on the [npm page for xlsx-js-style](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx-js-style).

## Learning More:

- Read my previous article on [How to Download xlsx Files](https://www.davegray.codes/posts/how-to-download-xlsx-files-from-a-nextjs-route-handler) if you want to create these files in a Node.js backend and request them from your frontend. My example is with Next.js, but you could just set it up in Node.js without Next.js. 

- If you read the previous article or watch the video below, remember to replace the `xlsx` dependency with the `xlsx-js-style` dependency I discussed in this article. 

Enjoy creating Excel spreadsheets with JavaScript!
