**TLDR:** Learn React drag and drop with the example missing from most tutorials.

## React Drag and Drop

Drag and drop can be a very useful feature in your React  application. 

In a music app, you may want to allow users to reorder songs in a playlist. 

In a workout app, you may want to allow users to reorder exercises in a workout plan. 

Or in a simple todo app, you may want to allow users to reorder tasks in a list. 

In all of these cases, adding drag and drop functionality to your application is a great way to make it more user-friendly.

## dndkit 

[dndkit](https://dndkit.com/) is a drag and drop library for React, and I'll be using it in this article.

I provided a [tutorial for react-beautiful-dnd](https://youtu.be/HeNVPF_fRXI) in the past, but at the time of this article, [dndkit](https://dndkit.com/) is the prevalent drag and drop library for React.

If you are interested, I also have a [drag and drop tutorial for Vanilla JS](https://youtu.be/9Xh_ZpFkROI). 

Let's get started with dndkit by installing it with npm:

```bash
npm i @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities
```

## The Missing Example

Most drag and drop code examples show data with an `id` field and other fields like `name` or `description`. 

```json
[
        {
            "id": 1,
            "artist": "The Beatles",
            "title": "Hey Jude",
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "artist": "Neil Young",
            "title": "My My, Hey Hey",
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "artist": "The Rolling Stones",
            "title": "Wild Horses",
        }
]
```

This makes a nice, simple example, but it ignores how it will likely integrate with a full stack application using a database.

The id field is often also the primary key for a table in the database. 

If we made changes to our playlist above, it would be better to save the playlist order with an additional field like `sequence` or `order`.

```json
[
        {
            "id": 1,
            "artist": "The Beatles",
            "title": "Hey Jude",
            "sequence": 1,
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "artist": "Neil Young",
            "title": "My My, Hey Hey",
            "sequence": 2,
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "artist": "The Rolling Stones",
            "title": "Wild Horses",
            "sequence": 3,
        }
]
```

Now, when we make changes to the playlist sequence, we can save it back to our database without impacting a primary key.

With this in mind, let's set up a drag and drop example with dndkit.

## List Component Imports

The example List component will receive data that is shaped liked the example data with the sequence field.
```tsx 

export type Item = {
    id: number,
    artist: string,
    title: string,
    sequence: number
}

type Props = {
    data: Item[]
}
```

Let's start with the necessary imports: 
```tsx 
// List.tsx 
import { useState } from 'react'

import {
    closestCenter, DragEndEvent, DragOverlay, DragStartEvent, PointerSensor, TouchSensor, useSensor,
    useSensors, DndContext
} from '@dnd-kit/core'

import { arrayMove, SortableContext, verticalListSortingStrategy } from '@dnd-kit/sortable'
```
I'm not going to go into detail describing each import. That would be like republishing the [docs for dndkit](https://docs.dndkit.com/), but feel free to read the docs and dive deeper on anything you want. 

## Client-side React vs Next.js 

Before I share the rest of the component code, I need to highlight one important difference between client-side React and Next.js. 

A traditional React app is all client-side code and can use the DndContext I show imported above. 

Next.js will do a server-side render of your component first - even if you use the `"use client"` directive. This will cause a `hydration mismatch` warning when you drag and drop because you are moving around DOM elements. 

If you're using Next.js, you will want to use a dynamic import instead of importing `DndContext` directly. 

Add this to your code: 
```tsx 
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic' 
// rest of imports here

const DndContextWithNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('@dnd-kit/core').then(mod => mod.DndContext), { ssr: false })
``` 
Now, instead of the `DndContext` import, you will use `DndContextWithNoSSR`. 

## List Component State &amp; Functions 

Below is the logic for the List component. It boils down to two state variables and four functions. 

For the most part, these examples are basic variations of what you will find in the documentation. However, what I believe is worthy to highlight is how the `sequence` and `id` properties interact. 

```tsx 
export function List({ data }: Props) {
    const [items, setItems] = useState(data)
    const [activeItem, setActiveItem] = useState<Item | undefined>(undefined)

    // for input methods detection
    const sensors = useSensors(useSensor(PointerSensor), useSensor(TouchSensor))

    const removeItem = (id: number) => {
        const updated = items.filter(item => item.id !== id).map((item, i) => ({ ...item, sequence: i + 1 }))

        setItems(updated)
    }

    // triggered when dragging starts
    const handleDragStart = (event: DragStartEvent) => {
        const { active } = event
        setActiveItem(items?.find(item => item.sequence === active.id))
    }

    const handleDragEnd = (event: DragEndEvent) => {
        const { active, over } = event

        if (!over) return

        const activeItem = items.find(ex => ex.sequence === active.id)
        const overItem = items.find(ex => ex.sequence === over.id)

        if (!activeItem || !overItem) {
            return
        }

        const activeIndex = items.findIndex(ex => ex.sequence === active.id)
        const overIndex = items.findIndex(ex => ex.sequence === over.id)

        if (activeIndex !== overIndex) {
            setItems(prev => {
                const updatedWorkoutData = arrayMove(prev, activeIndex, overIndex).map((ex, i) => ({ ...ex, sequence: i + 1 }))

                return updatedWorkoutData
            })
        }
        setActiveItem(undefined)
    }

    const handleDragCancel = () => {
        setActiveItem(undefined)
    }
// rest of component code here
```

## List Component Return Value 

Not too leave anything out, here is the return value of the List component. 

Note, this example is using the `DndContextWithNoSSR` import for Next.js. If you are using client-side React, you can use `DndContext` instead of `DndContextWithNoSSR`.

```tsx 
return (
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-2 w-1/2 mx-auto">
            {items?.length ? (
                <DndContextWithNoSSR
                    sensors={sensors}
                    collisionDetection={closestCenter}
                    onDragStart={handleDragStart}
                    onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
                    onDragCancel={handleDragCancel}
                >
                    <SortableContext
                        items={items.map(item => item.sequence)}
                        strategy={verticalListSortingStrategy}
                    >
                        {items.map(item => (
                            <SortableRow
                                key={item.id}
                                item={item}
                                removeItem={removeItem}
                            />
                        ))}
                    </SortableContext>

                    <DragOverlay adjustScale style={{ transformOrigin: "0 0 " }}>
                        {activeItem ? (
                            <SortableRow
                                item={activeItem}
                                removeItem={removeItem}
                                forceDragging={true}
                            />
                        ) : null}
                    </DragOverlay>
                </DndContextWithNoSSR>
            ) : null}
        </div>
    )
}
```
## SortableRow Component 

You've surely noticed there is a `SortableRow` component in the example above that I did not show with the other imports. 

Let's take a look at it and don't forget to import it in your List component after you create it. 

This component doesn't stray far from the typical examples I have seen, but again, I want to highlight where the `sequence` value comes into play.

```tsx 
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-react'

import { useSortable } from '@dnd-kit/sortable'
import { CSS } from '@dnd-kit/utilities'

import { Button } from './ui/button'

import type { Item } from "./List"

type Props = {
    item: Item,
    removeItem: (id: number) => void,
    forceDragging?: boolean,
}

export function SortableRow({ item, removeItem, forceDragging = false }: Props) {

    const {
        attributes,
        isDragging,
        listeners,
        setNodeRef,
        setActivatorNodeRef,
        transform,
        transition
    } = useSortable({
        id: item.sequence,
    })

    const parentStyles = {
        transform: CSS.Transform.toString(transform),
        transition: transition || undefined,
        opacity: isDragging ? "0.4" : "1",
        lineHeight: "4",
    }

    const draggableStyles = {
        cursor: isDragging || forceDragging ? "grabbing" : "grab",
    }

    return (
        <article
            className="flex flex-col w-full gap-2 [&:not(:first-child)]:pt-2" ref={setNodeRef}
            style={parentStyles}
        >
            <div className="bg-secondary w-full rounded-md flex items-center gap-2 overflow-hidden">

                <div className="bg-ring w-12 h-full flex items-center">
                    <p className="w-full text-center text-secondary">{item.sequence}</p>
                </div>

                <div
                    ref={setActivatorNodeRef}
                    className="flex-grow p-2"
                    style={draggableStyles}
                    {...attributes} {...listeners}
                >
                    <h2 className="text-lg">
                        {item.title}
                    </h2>
                    <p className="text-sm">{item.artist}</p>
                </div>

                <div className="w-12 h-full flex items-center">
                    <Button
                        type="button"
                        size="icon"
                        variant="outline"
                        onClick={() => removeItem(item.id)}
                    >
                        <XIcon className="text-red-500" />
                    </Button>
                </div>

            </div>

        </article>
    )
}
```

## Where to Go Next 

Admittedly, this article is a bit of a code dump. If you are trying to learn more about each detail of [dndkit](https://dndkit.com/), I recommend you read the [docs](https://dndkit.com/docs/overview) as they do hold a lot of information. 

My goal in sharing this article was to provide what I could not quickly find - an example of using [dndkit](https://dndkit.com/) where you do not change the `id` value of your data and instead, work with a separate `sequence` value.

If you were looking for the same thing, I hope this article has helped you.
