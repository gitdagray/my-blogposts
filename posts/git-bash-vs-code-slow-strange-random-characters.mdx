**TLDR:** If you're using git bash in VS Code and notice it slows down and/or starts printing random characters, here's how to fix it.

## The Problem

After a recent VS Code update, I noticed git bash really slowed down.  

Sometimes it even output random weird characters like the ones you see in my terminal window below.

## How to Fix It (for now)

Press `Ctrl+,` or click the cog icon in the bottom left of VS Code to open Settings. 

Use the search bar and search for `terminal integrated shell`. 

The setting for `Terminal > Integrated > Shell Integration > Enabled` should show up. 

Uncheck the box for this setting. 

If you don't find that setting, you can open the JSON settings file and add this line: 
`"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": false,`

## Check Back 

This seems to be a bug after a recent VS Code update. I don't think this setting provides anything I will miss, but if you do, you may want to check back and re-enable this in the future.
