**TLDR:** You can set up a Next.js Route Handler that creates and downloads Microsoft Excel (xlsx) files. 

## XLSX Files

No matter where you work as a developer, there's a good chance someone will ask you to send them an MS Excel spreadsheet sooner or later. Those files end with the extension xlsx or xls. 

At my job, I manage a large data project and regularly receive requests for table exports as spreadsheets. 

I decided to set up an API endpoint via Next.js route handler which will allow my boss and co-workers to create and download their own table exports on demand. 

## xlsx dependency

The [xlsx](https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/getting-started/installation/frameworks) package is also known as SheetJS. 

Install xlsx:

```bash
npm i --save https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.1/xlsx-0.20.1.tgz
```
**Note:** Do NOT get the xlsx package from the npm registry with `npm install xlsx`. Sheetjs has stopped using the public registry at version 18.5. You will see the version in the public registry is 2+ years old and has a high severity vulnerability now. You can confirm this vulnerability on the [Socket.dev xlsx page](https://socket.dev/npm/package/xlsx).

## Add xlsx to Your Project

Next, import xlsx into your project:

```ts 
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx'
```
My Next.js route handler starts by receiving a parameter with the requested table name. I'm also including some pseudo-code comments to allow you to follow the logic process until I get to the xlsx details.

```ts 
/* example path: /api/tables/[table] */

export async function GET(
    request: NextRequest,
    { params }: { params: { table: string } }
) {
    // check for authorized user first! 
    try {
        const { table } = params
        if (!table) throw new Error('Table name required')

        // check table name with list of table names here

        // if table doesn't exist, throw an error 

        // Query: SELECT * FROM table and get a JSON response 

    } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof Error) {
            return new Response(e.message, {
                status: 400,
            })
        }
    }
    

}
```

## Creating the XLSX File 

Here's the good stuff using the xlsx package:
 
```ts 
// ...previous code 

// Query: SELECT * FROM your table and get a JSON response

// Create a new XLSX workbook:
const workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new()

// Create a new worksheet: 
const worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(jsonTableData)

// Append the worksheet to the workbook: 
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, "MySheet")

// Create data buffer 
const buffer = XLSX.write(workbook, { type: "buffer", bookType: "xlsx" })

// Create and send a new Response
return new Response(buffer, {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
        'Content-Disposition': `attachment; filename="${table}.xlsx"`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/vnd.ms-excel',
    }
})

// } catch (e) { and rest of code...
```
You can find a similar example for a Node.js & Express server in the [SheetJS docs](https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/solutions/output#example-server-responses). 

The key to success here is creating the buffer with the `XLSX.write` method, and then sending it in the Response with the proper headers. 

## Other File Types

Do you want to download CSV (comma-separated) or TSV (tab-separated) files? 

Or maybe just display an HTML version? 

No problem! 

You can find all of the appropriate XLSX methods in the [SheetJS docs](https://docs.sheetjs.com/), but here is how I provide CSV downloads, too. 

I'm looking for a `format` parameter. If it equals `csv`, then I'm sending that file type instead. 

```ts
/* example path: /api/tables/[table]?format=csv */

// begin route handler code above 

// put this somewhere before the XLSX creation and response 
const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams
const format = searchParams.get('format')

if (format === 'csv') {

    const csv = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_csv(worksheet, {
        forceQuotes: true,
    })

    return new Response(csv, {
        status: 200,
        headers: {
            'Content-Disposition': `attachment; filename="${tableName}.csv"`,
            'Content-Type': 'text/csv',
        }
    })
}
```
## Final Notes:

- Always check for an authorized user. 

- Don't allow SQL injections. I'm verifying the `table` parameter with a list of accurate table names. Only those specific values are allowed. 

Enjoy creating downloads!
